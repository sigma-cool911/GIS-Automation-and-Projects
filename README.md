## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sigma-cool911/GIS-Automation-and-Projects.git
```

### Requirements

- **QGIS**: Ensure you have QGIS installed. This project is compatible with QGIS 3.x.
- **Python**: Python 3.x is required for running scripts.
- **Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

To install dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the automation models and workflows. Here are some examples of how to execute the scripts:

1. **Open QGIS**: Launch QGIS on your machine.
2. **Load the Model**: Open the model builder and load the automation model you want to use.
3. **Run the Model**: Execute the model to automate your workflow.

For specific use cases, refer to the documentation provided in the `docs` folder.
